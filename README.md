42 school's net_practice project focuses on IP addressing, routing and subnet masking.

## Status

Awaiting evaluation.

## Usage

This project takes place in a web training interface. The json files in this repository are my solutions to my particular set of net_practice levels. Each level has randomized IP adresses for each student login.

To launch the training interface, clone this repository and decompress the tar archive included in the subject directory: 

```shell
cd net_practice/subject
tar -xf net_practice.tgz
```

Then open the ```index.html``` file in your browser (works best with google chrome):

```shell
google-chrome net_practice/index.html
```
